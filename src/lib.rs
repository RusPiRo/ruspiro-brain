//! # RusPiRo Brain
//!
//! This is the **brain** of any RusPiRo - Robot running in a kind of 'async' processing mode.
//! As for a human brain it's quite unlikely that everything get's processed in a sequential order.
//! There are always several thoughts that are processed in parallel/simultaneous to accomplish a
//! certain goal - come to a conclusion or trigger an activity/movement.
//!
//! ## Hint
//! Rust provides the ``async``/``await`` pattern based on ``Future``s to enable a simple to use
//! programming style that results in asynchronous execution. The center of this pattern is
//! the so called ``Executor`` that will drive any open ``Future`` to it's completion. The ``Brain`` is nothing but the
//! specific executor running on a multicore Raspberry Pi.
//!
//!
