//! # RusPiRo Brain
//! This is the **brain** of any RusPiRo - Robot running in an async processing mode. As for a human
//! it's quite unlikely that everything get's processed in a sequential order. There are always several
//! tasks that are done in parallel or simultaneous to accomplish a certain goal.
//!
//! ## Hint
//! Rust provides the ``async``/``await`` pattern based on ``Future``s to enable a simple to use
//! programming style that results in parallel/simultaneous execution. The center of this pattern is
//! the so called ``Executor`` that will drive any open ``Future`` to it's completion. However, the
//! framework provided by Rust is stabilized but not available for **no_std** crates or **embedded**
//! developments. Therefore this crate *borrows* the concepts of Rust standard and implement a light-
//! weight version of this.
//!
//! ## Parts of this crate
//!
//! The following table gives an overview on the different peaces of this crate and their purpose and
//! allows to get some insights on how this things work together. In addition the corresponding Rust
//! standard entity who's concepts has been borrowed to implement this crate.
//!
//! The implementation has also been inspired by the [Rust Async Book](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book).
//! The names for structures and traits are choosen to give the whole implementation a bit more the
//! touch of an roboter that will be built with it...
//!
//! Trait / Structure | Rust 'std' comparable | Description
//! ------------------|-----------------------|---------------
//! ``Thought``       | [``Future``](https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.1/futures/prelude/trait.Future.html) | The abstract thing a brain can process. But to come to a conclusion the ``Brain`` need to actively **think** on it.
//! ``Task``          | | This a logical unit containg a ``Thought`` the ``Brain`` can think on to drive it to a ``Conclusion``. It also contains a reference to the ``Brain``s ``Spawner`` to be able to put this ``Task`` back onto the Queue of things to think on again.
//! ``spawn``         | | This function is used to spawn new ``Thought``s to the ``Brain`` so it could think on those to make progress and try to come to a conclusion. The ``Thought`` is internally wrapped into a ``Task`` and pushed to the *need-to-think-on-queue*
