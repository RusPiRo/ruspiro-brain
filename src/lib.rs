//! # RusPiRo Brain
//! 
//! This is the **brain** of any RusPiRo - Robot running in a kind of 'async' processing mode.
//! As for a human brain it's quite unlikely that everything get's processed in a sequential order.
//! There are always several thoughts that are processed in parallel/simultaneous to accomplish a
//! certain goal - come to a conclusion or trigger an activity/movement.
//!
//! ## Hint
//! Rust provides the ``async``/``await`` pattern based on ``Future``s to enable a simple to use
//! programming style that results in asynchronous execution. The center of this pattern is
//! the so called ``Executor`` that will drive any open ``Future`` to it's completion. However, the
//! framework provided by Rust is stabilized but not available for **no_std** crates or **embedded**
//! developments. Therefore this crate *borrows* the concepts of the Rust standard and implement a
//! light-weight and feature reduced version of this.
//!
//! ## Parts of this crate
//! The following table gives an overview on the different peaces of this crate and their purpose and
//! allows to get some insights on how this things work together. In addition the corresponding Rust
//! standard entity who's concepts has been borrowed to implement this crate.
//!
//! The implementation has also been inspired by the [Rust Async Book](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book).
//! The names for structures and traits are choosen to give the whole implementation a bit more the
//! touch of an roboter that will be built with it...
//!
//! Trait / Structure | Rust 'std' comparable | Brief description
//! ------------------|-----------------------|---------------
//! [``Thinkeable``]  | [``Future``](https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.1/futures/prelude/trait.Future.html) | The abstract things a brain can process need to implement this trait. But to come to a ``Conclusion`` the ``Brain`` need to actively **think** on it.
//! [``Thought``]     | | This a logical unit containg a ``Thought`` the ``Brain`` can think on to drive it to a ``Conclusion``. It also contains a reference to the ``Brain``s ``Spawner`` to be able to put this ``Task`` back onto the Queue of things to think on again.
//! [``Conclusion``]  | [``Poll``](https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.1/futures/task/enum.Poll.html) | This is the representation of the outcome of thinking on a ``Thinkable``. It could either be the actual result or indicating a pending state meaning this need to re-thought by the brain. 
//! [``Wakeable``]    | [``ArcWake``](https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.1/futures/task/trait.ArcWake.html) | This trait is implemented for the ``Thought`` and indicates that this one could be re-thought by the brain by waking it.
//! [``Waker``]       | | This is the abstract representation of something that could be waken up. It could be seen as a storage for a ``RawWaker`` that contains the function pointers to the ``Wakeable``s wake functions.
//! [``Context``]     | | This is actually the container used to pass the the ``Waker`` along to the ``Thinkable`` to allow the same to use the contained ``Waker`` (a clone of it) to be registers for waking up this ``Thinkable`` if it was not yet able to provide a ``Conclusion``
//! [``spawn``]       | | This function is used to spawn new ``Thinkables``s to the ``Brain`` so it could think on those to make progress and try to come to a ``Conclusion``. The ``Thinkable`` is internally wrapped into a ``Thought`` and pushed to the *need-to-think-on-queue*
